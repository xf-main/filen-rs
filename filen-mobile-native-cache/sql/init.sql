--   with a guard that does not name `change_seq`, so it stops there; it names
--   no id column either, so the `AFTER UPDATE OF` triggers never fire from it.
-- * Every OLD/NEW comparison uses `IS NOT`, never `!=`. `hash`, `created`,
--   `color` and `stable_uuid` are nullable, and on a NULL -> value transition
--   `!=` yields NULL rather than TRUE, silently swallowing the change.
-- * One logical write can bump more than once (a new file is an `items` insert
--   plus a `files` insert plus a `files_meta` insert, so three). Accepted: a
--   diff returns the row once, at its latest sequence, and the only cost is
