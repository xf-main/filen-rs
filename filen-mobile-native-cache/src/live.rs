//! The live path: an always-on socket subscription feeding `native_cache.db` directly.
//!
//! An `NSFileProviderReplicatedExtension` never re-enumerates a MATERIALIZED container on its own
//! — the working set is the only channel by which remote changes to such a container reach the
//! system, and the working set only moves when something writes this database. This module is
//! that writer: it subscribes to the drive's socket events **unconditionally at auth** (no
//! engine, no sync roots, no registration dance), applies each event through the same upserts a
//! listing refresh uses — so the change-sequence and tombstone triggers fire exactly as they do
//! for anything else — and pokes the working-set listener, whose platform side answers with
//! `signalEnumerator(.workingSet)`.
//!
//! One channel, one drainer: the socket thread's callback only deep-copies the event and sends
//! it; a single consumer applies strictly in delivery order, so an edit's `fileNew` can never be
//! undone by the trash event that retired its predecessor being applied after it.
//!
//! The relevance gate keeps this O(1) per event and stops the cache growing on its own: an event
//! is applied only when the cache already holds the row it names OR that row's parent. Anything
//! else is a container this device has never listed — dropped, because that folder is listed on
//! first browse anyway.
//!
//! LOCK DISCIPLINE, inherited from the tracking module this replaces: tokio's `RwLock` is fair,
//! so a queued auth-refresh writer parks every later reader behind whoever holds a read guard.
//! The drainer takes the guard PER EVENT, and the common (local-only) arms hold it across
//! nothing but SQL. The one arm that reaches the network (`trashEmpty`'s trash relist) holds it
//! the way every FFI operation already does — for its own duration only.
