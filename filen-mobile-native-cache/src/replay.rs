//! Closing a drive gap by REPLAYING `v3/user/events` instead of re-listing everything.
//!
//! The gap pass this fronts ([`crate::live::gap_check`]) re-lists every materialized
//! container — ~3,000 `dir/content` round trips on a real account, tens of seconds on wifi and
//! minutes on cellular, and it costs the same whether the gap is 12,000 events or 8. The event
//! log can say WHICH containers moved, so the common case becomes a listing or two.
//!
//! This module deliberately does NOT apply event payloads to rows. It resolves each event to
//! the container(s) whose listing would show the change, and hands those to the existing
//! [`refresh_container`](crate::auth::AuthCacheState::refresh_container). Three hard problems
//! disappear with that choice, and none of them can come back:
//!
//! - **Order stops mattering.** A container is re-listed once no matter how many events named
//!   it, so the log's `id` ordering (which does not always agree with its own timestamps) and
//!   any within-second interleaving are irrelevant.
//! - **Terminality stops mattering.** Whether a `fileVersioned` without a successor retired the
//!   lineage for good, or a `fileTrash` merely trashed it, is the listing's answer to give —
//!   we never guess, and never delete a row on an inference.
//! - **Thin payloads stop mattering.** The log omits `color`/`favorited` on folder events and
//!   the full record on `itemFavorite`; reconstructing rows from that would silently clobber
//!   columns the event never carried.
//!
//! The listing remains the authority, exactly as it is for a browse. Replay only decides where
//! to point it.
//!
//! ## What forces the full pass anyway
//!
//! Replay is an optimization and refuses rather than guesses. [`ReplayOutcome::Fallback`] is
//! returned when there is no cursor yet, when an event in the range cannot be decoded or
//! attributed, when `deleteAll` appears, when paging cannot reach the cursor, or when the
//! targeted set grows big enough that the sweep is cheaper anyway.
//!
//! ## Paging without a sub-second cursor
//!
//! `v3/user/events` takes one seconds-resolution `timestamp` and returns the events at or
//! before it, so paging backwards means re-asking with the oldest timestamp seen. A second
//! holding more events than one page therefore cannot be paged through: asking again returns
//! the same page. That is detected rather than assumed — a page contributing no new event id
//! is no progress, and no progress falls back. The cursor is a whole SECOND and the range is
//! re-applied inclusively, which needs no id bookkeeping because re-listing a container is
//! idempotent.
