//! Fetch-and-verify for the pinned RAW samples in [`pins`].
//!
//! Three properties this module exists to guarantee:
//!
//! * **Only pinned URLs are requested.** There is no directory listing and no
//!   scraping. The set of bytes these tests can ever see is exactly the table
//!   in `pins.rs`.
//! * **The hash is checked on every run**, not only after a download. A cached
//!   file that no longer matches its pin is a hard error, so the tests can
//!   never quietly run against bytes we do not recognise.
//! * **Missing bytes are a skip, not a failure.** A machine with no network and
//!   a cold cache must still pass; it prints which fixture and which URL it
//!   could not get.
//!
//! Fetching shells out to `curl` rather than linking an HTTP client. microthumb
//! is deliberately dependency-light and has no network stack; the alternative
//! routes are worse. Going through `test-utils` would mean
//! `test-utils -> filen-sdk-rs -> microthumb`, a dev-dependency cycle, and
//! adding `ureq`/`reqwest` would drag a TLS stack (or a whole async runtime)
//! into the dev-tree of a leaf crate whose entire point is not having one.
//! `curl` ships on macOS, on Linux CI images and on Windows 10+; when it is
//! absent the fixture is simply unavailable, which is already a supported
//! state. The one dev-dependency added is `blake3`, which the workspace
//! already builds.
