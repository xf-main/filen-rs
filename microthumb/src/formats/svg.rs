//! SVG via `resvg` (usvg + tiny-skia), built with every default feature off:
//! no text (no font database — text elements render as nothing, which beats
//! shipping megabytes of fonts to a mobile binary), no raster-images, no
//! system-font or filesystem access, no gzip — `.svgz` (magic `1f 8b`) never
//! matches the sniff and is refused on purpose, since supporting it would buy
//! an inflate dependency plus an unbounded-decompression guard for a format
//! nobody uploads.
//!
//! Being a vector format, the raster size is OURS to pick: `open` derives the
//! aspect from the root tag (`width`/`height` when absolute, else `viewBox`,
//! else square) and commits to a raster covering the — already budget-clamped
//! — target. Unlike the raster formats a small nominal size is still rendered
//! at the target: scaling up is what vectors are for.
//!
//! The document is an untrusted XML file, and the hostile cases are not
//! memory-shaped in the usual way, so the guards are explicit:
//! - roxmltree (under usvg) refuses external entities and bounds internal
//!   entity expansion (depth 10, 255 refs), but expansion is still quadratic
//!   in document size — any `<!ENTITY` declaration is refused outright.
//! - usvg resolves `<use>` by deep-copying the referenced subtree, and copies
//!   a `<marker>` subtree once per shape vertex — both during the parse, with
//!   no bound short of its 1M-node backstop (hundreds of MB, far beyond any
//!   budget here; and marker copies are made in a later stage that the
//!   backstop never sees at all). A memoised pre-pass costs the expansion from
//!   the raw XML and refuses before `usvg::Tree::from_str` sees the document.
//!   The marker charge lives INSIDE the per-node cost so that it multiplies
//!   through `<use>` the way usvg does; a marker that could carry another
//!   marker turns that product into a chain with no fixed point and is
//!   refused outright.
//! - resvg sizes a `<pattern>` tile pixmap from the pattern rect with no
//!   clamp at all: `<pattern>` documents are refused.
//! - tiny-skia builds up to a million dash segments per path before giving up
//!   on a `stroke-dasharray`, which a 200-byte document can reach; the dash
//!   count is estimated from the parsed path and charged to the same render
//!   allowance as the layers.
//! - both image href resolvers are overridden to answer `None`: the default
//!   string resolver reads local files, and nothing here may touch the
//!   filesystem or decode embedded rasters.
//! - the XML layer recurses per nesting level and a deep enough document
//!   overflows the decode thread's stack — an ABORT, not a catchable panic —
//!   so nesting is counted in the byte scan and refused past 1024, matching
//!   usvg's own (too-late) cap.
//! - filter primitives cost CPU and region-sized buffers per primitive, so
//!   their count is capped; isolated-group layers (opacity, clip, mask,
//!   filter) each allocate a sub-pixmap at render time, so a fixed allowance
//!   for them is priced into every estimate and the parsed tree's worst
//!   concurrent stack — each layer clamped the way resvg clamps it — is held
//!   to that allowance before rendering starts.
//!
//! The scans work on the raw text and count a match inside a comment or CDATA
//! block as real — refusing a weird-but-benign document is acceptable, missing
//! a hostile one is not.
