//! Camera RAW containers, via the preview image they carry.
//!
//! A RAW file is a sensor mosaic, not a picture: demosaicing one is a decode
//! this crate has no business attempting, and the `tiff` crate's attempt is
//! worse than nothing — on a NEF it decodes IFD0, which is a 160x120 postage
//! stamp beside a 12 MP photograph, and hands it back for a 512 px request.
//! Every camera writes a real JPEG of the shot alongside the mosaic, though,
//! so the whole job here is *finding* that JPEG. Once found it is handed to
//! the ordinary JPEG decoder over a [`SubSource`] window, which means the
//! IDCT-scaled decode, the peak estimate and the budget check are the same
//! ones every other format gets — nothing about RAW is special downstream.
//!
//! Where the preview hides, verified against 80 pinned samples:
//!
//! | Container | Where |
//! |---|---|
//! | CR2 | IFD0's single strip (a full-size JPEG) |
//! | NEF, ARW, DNG, SRW | a SubIFD's `JPEGInterchangeFormat`, or its strip |
//! | PEF | a chained IFD's `JPEGInterchangeFormat` |
//! | RW2 | Panasonic's private tag `0x002E`, a bare JPEG blob |
//! | ORF | inside the Olympus maker note (see [`walk_olympus`]) |
//!
//! Some Nikon and DNG files carry no JPEG at all, only a small uncompressed
//! RGB strip; that is picked up too, since a 320x213 preview still beats no
//! thumbnail.
//!
//! Everything here reads attacker-controlled offsets. Directory recursion is
//! depth- and count-capped, every offset and length is checked against the
//! source length before a read, and a candidate is only believed once its
//! bytes have been looked at — a header claiming "4000x3000 JPEG" that does
//! not start with an SOI is discarded, not trusted.
